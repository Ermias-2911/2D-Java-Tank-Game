## 2D Tank Game 
The goal of this term project is to practice good OOP. <br/>
This project will consist of two 2D games written in Java. <br/>
I implemented all the requirements listed bellow. <br/>  

### Game Requirements

1. Tank Game must have 2 Players <br/>
2. Tank Game must have tanks that move forwards and backwards <br/>
3. Tank Game Must have tanks that rotate so they can move in all directions <br/>
a. Note when only rotating left or right, the tank MUST NOT move forwards or backwards. <br/>
4. Tank Game must have a split screen.<br/>
5. Tank Game must have a mini-map. <br/>
6. Tank Game must have health bars for each tank. <br/>
7. Tank Game must have lives count (how many lives left before game over) for each tank. <br/>
8. Tank Game must have power up. <br/>
9. Tank game must have unbreakable walls. <br/>
10. Tank game must have breakable walls. <br/>
11. Tank Game must have tanks that can shoot bullets that collide with walls. <br/>
12. Tank Game must have tanks that can shoot bullets that collide with other tanks. <br/>



### To Run the Game:
1. Run "application.jar" <br/>
2. Press enter to start the game <br/>

### Controller:
- Player 1: WASD, SPACE to shoot, A to turn left, D to turn right,  W to move forward, and S to move backward. <br/>
